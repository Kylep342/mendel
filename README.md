# Mendel
Mendel is an app for managing lineages

## Design

Focused on 2 domains initially:
 houseplants/plants
 LLMs

Goal - Allow for the characterization and assessment of traits across generational objects (plant/LLM; the THING)


 - plant (THING)
    - is in a plantCultivar
    - is in a plantSpecies

 - harvest
    - occurs to plants
    - yields food/seeds that will determine genetics (expressed ones)

New naming hierarchy:
species -> cultivar -> plant
crop -> cultivar -> plant
